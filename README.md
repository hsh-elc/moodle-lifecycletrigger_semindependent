# moodle-lifecycletrigger_semindependent
This is a trigger-Subplugin for the admin tool [moodle-tool_lifecycle](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle). 
The basic setting at our institution is, that courses with a start date before the 1.1.2000 
are considered semester independent. All others are belonging to a specific semester such as winter semester 19/20.
This plugin can be used to filter semester independent courses from courses that belong to a semester.
## Settings
For each trigger instance it can be defined if semester independent courses should be included or excluded.

[Wiki](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle/wiki) of the lifecycle admin tool.
